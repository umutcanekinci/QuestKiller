# Quest Killer

This is an application of my not complated archieve from my highschool years:)
I made this quiz application for students of my middle school to improve their vocabulary skills.
But, it's mysql server provider have stopped giving free mysql databases. So, this application can't connecting to database anymore. In this way, we cant login or register, for now it is just a GUI application.
I just uploaded it because it's my first PyQt5 app and (I believe) it has beautiful GUI.
